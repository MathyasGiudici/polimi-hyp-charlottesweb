      title: "What is essential is invisible to the eye",
      description: "This is probably the best-known phrase in the book. I read it for the first time at the age of eight and it seemed like a beautiful fairy tale; one of those fun and carefree fairy tales that you read in one go. I read it again at fifteen and understood many things that I had initially underestimated and misunderstood; I read it again at twenty and finally understood an important meaning of the book: men, growing up, lose touch with the small important things and no longer grasp the meaning of what they live, experience and possess; only by looking at the world with the eyes of a child, with that extraordinary ability to be amazed and moved by every little thing, one can understand that \"the essential is invisible to the eyes\" .. but not to the heart. I've read it many times since then and every time I add a piece to my life.",

      title: "Beautiful Novel!",
      description: "My 8 year old daughter read and reread this book. And a story also suitable for older kids and adults, why not? This story makes us think of life, of really important things and of happiness. Even if it looks like a fairy tale where the girl understands the language of the animals, simultaneously and one of the most realistic stories for a young reader, where death is confronted with all the triestezza that it brings. But at the same time, the death of a friend is almost a catharsis, after which our pig becomes more mature, more grateful, but at the same time even more hopeful, with clear ideas what to do in the future ...",

      title: "Five stars",
      description: "I start by saying that I wanted to buy this book for a long time. I looked for the most beautiful and artistic version and found this. The purchase arrived in a few days. I recommend this edition because at the beginning of the book there is a section on the life of Jane Austen, which in my opinion is very interesting if you are curious to learn more about the writer. I finished reading it two days ago and loved it! In case like you have seen the film with Keira Knightley, I can tell you that the first chapters are identical, but that later on there is a clear difference, both in the narrated facts and in the feelings expressed by the protagonists.",
